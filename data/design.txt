Spawn points for 2 teams for different maps
    entity with tags: spawn_point, COLOR_spawn, function, active
    where function can be lobby or map_NUMBER

    players should be able to change the map and tp to the map and lobby without being OP if they are not in the arena
    after falling or dying in the arena tp to back to the respective Spawn point
    a player can always go back to the lobby by using /trigger to_lobby 

Kits
    There are several kits, each with their quirks.
    A player can change kits if not in the arena.
    Each kit has an ultimate which can be used if lvl 100 is reached
    Each kit has items which reload after x ticks

Objective types
    Deathmatch - kill the oposite team and make x kills 
        - scoreboard for team kills
        - end if a team has x kills
        scoreboard objectives add RedKills killedByTeam.red

    King of the hill - hold a central point for x ticks
        - capturing the central point takes x ticks and goes faster if more team members are on it.
        - capturing is blocked if an enemy is on it
        - end if team has captured it for long enough
        - display status on scoreboard, capturing on bossbar
        /execute at @e[tag=control_point] store result score Red InRange if entity @e[team=Red,distance=..4]
        /execute at @e[tag=control_point] store result score Blue InRange if entity @e[team=Blue,distance=..4]

    capture the flag - take an item from enemy base to own base x times
        - have an item spawn with infinite life time in each base
        - display coloured particles on carrier of the team

Features for each map
    Mana Well - drop mana orbs which give the player levels
    control point - 
        point in the map which needs to be captured by a team
        emit particles around the area of influence
